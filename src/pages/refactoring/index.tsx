              Big Dev says keep the Clean Code, Little Dev creates variables named 'a' & 'b' 
              and function 'function()'. \n 
              The idea behind such concept is basically BE OBVIOUS, 
              and trust me, this is really hard.
              
              Based on this, try to remember this incridible sentences, or just try to understand what they mean.

              - Clean Code is obvious, not sophisticated or clever. Make it pop the eyes, not the brain.

            - Clean Code !== Duplication, but this doesnt mean you should repeat yourself. (DRY link)

            - Clean Code is small code, less parts, less problems. (this one is gold.)

            - Clean Code passes all tests. (Tests are big enemy, we talk about them later.)

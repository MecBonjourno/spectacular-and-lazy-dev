        content="Clean code, for some devs this work as a magical word. 
              Big Dev says keep the Clean Code, Little Dev creates variables named 'a' & 'b' 
              and function 'function()'. \n 
              The idea behind such concept is basically BE OBVIOUS, 
              and trust me, this is really hard.
              
              Based on this, try to remember this incridible sentences, or just try to understand what they mean.

              - Clean Code is obvious, not sophisticated or clever. Make it pop the eyes, not the brain.

            - Clean Code !== Duplication, but this doesnt mean you should repeat yourself. (DRY link)

            - Clean Code is small code, less parts, less problems. (this one is gold.)

            - Clean Code passes all tests. (Tests are big enemy, we talk about them later.)

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Job (Business, Pressure, Deliveries, etc)</h2>
            This one is always the first one to blame, every time, we receive a due date for something, it can be a month, a week
            Three hours, or the next World Cup. As a ADHD person, we know we will do it in the last minute
            (This one especially doesnt apply to my job, but for some personal stuff is the modus operandi).
            And just like that, you had to move to the next sprint, so you just copy and paste that function that you wrote, or copy something from the web and ship it. (You know what happens after...)

            employers or whatever, and they dont understand it. And don't let the team "waste" time on refactoring it. Yeah its funny.
            The not so funny part is when shit explodes and its your fault, the employer/client never is at fault.
            never. NEVER, THEY ARE GODS ON EARTH.`}

          <p className="text-lg  mb-4">
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4"> Lack of tests</h2>
            We haven't even talked about them yet, but yeah they are important (or so they say).
            I'll just say one thing "Just test in prod". That's it you got it. It obvious, and consequences? <span className='font-bold'>Catastrophe</span> on the project/product/service. Even worse: <span className='font-bold'>You caused it </span>
            just cuz you thought that smelly little function wouldn't do anything harmful.

          <p className="text-lg  mb-4">
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4"> Lack of Documentation</h2>
            Okay, this one I've faced a lot. Documentations usually are left behind or apart of the quality of the project.
            Just not sure why, or if is intended. But for sure, a documentation that is poorly written or not written
            at all will slow down the development of the project. And if you are a new dev on the project, you will have a bad time.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg  mb-4">
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Communication</h2>
            Communication is key. Talking is key, gossip is key for the humankind (I'm not joking, its a fact. Don't believe me? Read Sapiens.).
            <br />
            Now think how talking about the project, the code, the architecture, the design, the tests, the documentation, the deadline can bring a lot of benefits to the devs around. Talk about it!

          <p className="text-lg  mb-4">
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Incompetence</h2>
            This one is special. I'm not saying that you are incompetent (or am I?), but you know someone that is (maybe you ü§î?), and you know that person is the one that will create the most technical debts. So think about it, maybe helping earlier may give you some hours back in your day....
